See test.js

I'm not sure if it'll meet your expectations but I tried my best to follow the instruction. I put to codes all the logic that I've thought during my assessment for the tasks.


Task 1 has been tested by injecting codes to the browser's console.


Task 2 hasn't been tested yet since it may need more codes for cosmetics such as icons and css implementations. Since it'll involve css and designing, I may not make it during the 4 hour period. I only put the logic during the timeframe, hope it helps.
